Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.\n",

    "### Notes on XGBoost parameters tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually we start tuning parameters with these first: <br>\n",
    "`n_estimators` - number of algorithms; <br>\n",
    "`max_depth` - maximum depth of a tree, increase this value will make the model more complex; <br>\n",
    "`min_child_weight` - minimum sum of instance weight (hessian) needed in a child <br>\n",
    "`gamma` - minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree <br>\n",
    "as they will have the highest impact on model outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control Overfitting\n",
    "When you observe high training accuracy, but low tests accuracy, it is likely that you encounter overfitting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are in general two ways that you can control overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first way is to directly control model complexity\n",
    "This include `max_depth` - maximum depth of a tree, increase this value will make the model more complex; <br>\n",
    "`min_child_weight` - minimum sum of instance weight needed in a child; <br>\n",
    "`gamma` - minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The second way is to add randomness to make training robust to noise\n",
    "This include `subsample` - subsample ratio of the training instance,\n",
    "`colsample_bytree` - subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree. <br>\n",
    "You can also reduce stepsize `eta`  -step size shrinkage used in update to prevents overfitting,\n",
    "but needs to remember to increase `num_round` (the number of rounds for boosting)  when you do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handle Imbalanced Dataset\n",
    "There are two ways to improve it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you care only about the ranking order (AUC) of your prediction\n",
    "Balance the positive and negative weights, via `scale_pos_weight`\n",
    "Use AUC for evaluation\n",
    "* If you care about predicting the right probability\n",
    "In such a case, you cannot re-balance the dataset\n",
    "In such a case, set parameter `max_delta_step` to a finite number (say 1) will help convergence <br>\n",
    "\n",
